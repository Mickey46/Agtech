# Agtech - Real-time Computer Vision and Object Detection

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for various **real-time computer vision** tasks, inspired by the complex visual system of the **mantis shrimp**. The project aims to mimic the mantis shrimp's advanced vision capabilities, such as detecting subtle details in images that may be camouflaged or hidden.

The scripts in this repository include:
- **Real-time camera input handling**
- **Interactive color picking for object detection**
- **Image processing techniques to detect and track objects**
- **Visualization and user interaction with detected objects**

## Installation

### Requirements:
Before running the scripts, ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You will also need the following libraries:

- **OpenCV** for video capture and image processing
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
- **Scikit-Image** for image resizing
- **Torch** for tensor operations (for smoothing filters and processing)

### Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-image torch
